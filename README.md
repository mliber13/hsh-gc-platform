## Overview

This application is designed to create a complete feedback loop for general contractors:

```
Estimate/Takeoff â†’ Execute Project â†’ Collect Actuals â†’ Improve Future Estimates
     â†‘____________________________________________________________â†“
```

Unlike traditional systems that keep estimating and execution separate, this platform integrates both phases to continuously improve accuracy based on real project data.

## Core Modules

### 1. Pre-Construction
- **Estimating**: Comprehensive estimate workflow based on proven Excel methodology
- **Takeoff**: Quantity measurements and material lists
- **Budgeting**: Labor hours, material costs, subcontractor management
- **Baseline Creation**: Establishes project baseline for variance tracking

### 2. Project Execution
- **Cost Tracking**: Track actual labor hours, materials, and subcontractor costs
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor completion percentages and milestone dates
- **Change Orders**: Manage scope changes with cost impact analysis
- **Daily Logs**: Document site conditions, issues, and decisions

### 3. Intelligence & Analysis
- **Variance Analysis**: Compare estimated vs. actual costs by trade and scope
- **Historical Database**: Build a library of actual costs by project type
- **Productivity Rates**: Track real labor productivity rates
- **Material Waste**: Analyze actual waste percentages

### 4. Feedback Loop
- **Smart Estimates**: Auto-populate future estimates with historical rates
- **Risk Identification**: Flag high-variance items for closer attention
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Understand your real costs vs. market rates

## Technology Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Radix UI** for accessible component primitives
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **jsPDF** for document generation
- **date-fns** for date management

## Data Model Philosophy

The system is built around a **Cost Breakdown Structure (CBS)** that links estimates to actuals at every level:

- **Project** â†’ Contains estimates and actuals
- **Trade/Scope** â†’ Tracks variance by construction activity
- **Historical Rates** â†’ Feeds future estimates with real data
- **Confidence Levels** â†’ Indicates data reliability based on sample size

## Development Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React best practices (hooks, functional components)
- Keep components small and focused
- Use custom hooks for business logic
- Maintain consistent styling with Tailwind
- Write reusable UI components in `components/ui`

## Future Integrations

- QuickBooks Online for accounting
- Procore/Buildertrend for project management
- Takeoff software integration
- Mobile apps for field data collection
- Cloud storage for documents
