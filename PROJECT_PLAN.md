# HSH GC Platform - Development Plan

## Vision

Create a unified platform that connects estimating with project execution, using real project data to continuously improve future estimates. This "learning system" differentiates us from traditional estimating software by closing the feedback loop.

## Core Value Proposition

**"Make every estimate smarter than the last"**

By tracking what actually happens on projects and comparing it to estimates, we build institutional knowledge that compounds over time.

## Technical Architecture

### Data Model

```typescript
interface Project {
  id: string
  name: string
  client: string
  type: 'residential' | 'commercial' | 'remodel' | 'new-build'
  status: 'estimating' | 'awarded' | 'in-progress' | 'complete'
  
  // Estimate phase
  estimate: {
    trades: Trade[]
    takeoff: TakeoffItem[]
    overhead: number
    profit: number
    totalEstimate: number
  }
  
  // Execution phase
  actuals: {
    laborCosts: LaborEntry[]
    materialCosts: MaterialEntry[]
    subcontractorCosts: SubEntry[]
    totalActual: number
  }
  
  // Metadata
  createdAt: Date
  startDate?: Date
  completionDate?: Date
  variance?: number
}

interface Trade {
  id: string
  name: string
  quantity: number
  unit: string
  laborRate: number
  materialRate: number
  totalCost: number
}

interface LaborEntry {
  date: Date
  trade: string
  hours: number
  crew: string[]
  rate: number
  total: number
}
```

### Storage Strategy

**Phase 1-2**: localStorage
- Fast development
- No backend needed
- Easy to test
- Export/backup capability

**Phase 3+**: Cloud Database
- Supabase or Firebase
- Real-time sync
- Multi-device support
- Better data security

- Estimates can be saved and retrieved

### Phase 2
- Can track costs on active projects
- Data entry takes < 10 minutes per day
- Have actuals for at least 3 completed projects

### Phase 3
- Historical database has enough data for meaningful averages
- New estimates show "suggested" values based on history
- Variance analysis identifies improvement opportunities

### Phase 4
- Using exclusively for all bids
- Team members can use without training
- Estimates are measurably more accurate

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Too complex to build/maintain
**Mitigation**: Start with MVP, add features incrementally based on actual use

### Risk: Doesn't match actual workflow
**Mitigation**: Build estimating first (you know this workflow), validate before building execution tracking

### Risk: Data entry is too time-consuming
**Mitigation**: Focus on efficient input methods, import capabilities, mobile-friendly entry

### Risk: Historical data isn't useful
**Mitigation**: Design variance analysis early, adjust data collection if needed

## Getting Started - Next Steps

1. **Define the Estimate Structure**: List all trades and line items you typically estimate
2. **Create Mock Data**: Build a sample estimate for a real project in code
3. **Build First Screen**: Create the estimate entry form
4. **Validate**: Use it for one real bid
5. **Iterate**: Adjust based on actual use

**First coding session goal**: Create a working estimate form for one trade (e.g., framing) with quantities, units, and costs.
