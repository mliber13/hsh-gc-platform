# 🚀 Phase 2 - Roadmap

**Focus:** Intelligence, Automation, and Subcontractor Collaboration

---

## 📋 Immediate Priority (Tomorrow)

### 1. **Data Backup Feature** ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY
**What:** One-click button to download all data as JSON to local hard drive  
**Why:** Safety net, daily peace of mind  
**Difficulty:** ⭐ Easy (2-3 hours)  
**Implementation:**
- Add "Backup Data" button in User Menu
- Export all Supabase data to JSON file
- Include timestamp in filename
- Could also add auto-backup schedule (weekly)
- Restore functionality for emergencies

**Technical Notes:**
- Already have export experience from migration tool
- Just need to query all tables and bundle into JSON
- Browser download API handles file saving

## 🎯 Phase 2 - Core Features

### 2. **Smart Schedule Management & Subcontractor Notifications** ⭐⭐⭐ HIGH VALUE
**What:** Automated schedule updates sent to subcontractors  
**Why:** Eliminate manual coordination, reduce delays, professional communication  
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐ Medium (1-2 weeks)

**Features:**
- Email/SMS notifications when schedule changes affect a sub
- "My Schedule" view for subcontractors (read-only portal)
- Automated reminders (3 days before, 1 day before)
- Confirmation system (sub can confirm/decline availability)
- Weather delay automatic rescheduling
- Mobile-friendly notifications

**Technical Approach:**
- Use Supabase Edge Functions for email sending (or integrate SendGrid/Twilio)
- Create subcontractor portal (minimal auth, view-only)
- Schedule change triggers → notification pipeline
- SMS for urgent changes, email for updates
- Track confirmation status in database

**Database Changes:**
```sql
- Add subcontractor_contacts table (name, email, phone, trades)
- Add schedule_notifications table (sent_at, read_at, confirmed_at)
- Add notification_preferences (email/sms, timing)
```

### 3. **Intelligent Budget Learning & Suggestions** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ HIGH VALUE
**What:** AI-powered budget recommendations based on completed project data  
**Why:** Learn from reality, improve accuracy over time, reduce estimation errors  
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Medium-Hard (2-3 weeks)

**Features:**
- Compare Estimate vs Actuals for completed projects
- Identify consistent variances by category/trade
- Suggest adjustments: "Drywall typically runs 12% over estimate"
- Threshold-based alerts (e.g., variance > 10%)
- "Accept Suggestion" or "Ignore" workflow
- Historical trend charts
- Item-level learning (material costs trending up)

**Example Dashboard:**
```
📊 Budget Intelligence Dashboard

⚠️ Suggested Adjustments:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Drywall - Interior Finishes                         │
│ • Current estimate: $4.50/sqft                      │
│ • Actual average: $5.15/sqft (+14%)                 │
│ • Projects analyzed: 8                              │
│ • Confidence: High                                  │
│ [Accept Adjustment] [Ignore] [Details]              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Technical Approach:**
- Create analytics service to calculate variances
- Store "learning data" in new table
- Threshold configuration (admin sets sensitivity)
- Machine learning optional (start with simple statistical analysis)
- Visualization with charts (recharts library)

**Database Changes:**
```sql
- Add budget_analytics table (category, avg_variance, confidence_score)
- Add budget_suggestions table (suggestion_text, status, created_at)
- Add adjustment_history table (track accepted changes)
```

**Advanced Features (Future):**
- Pattern recognition: "Winter projects cost 8% more"
- Region-based adjustments
- Market price trends integration
- Predictive modeling for project duration

3. ✅ Good foundation of services and components
4. ✅ You understand the domain and requirements

### **Feature Breakdown:**

#### **1. Data Backup** - ⭐ EASY
- **Time:** 2-3 hours
- **Why:** We've already done similar exports, just need download button
- **Confidence:** Very High

#### **2. Schedule Notifications** - ⭐⭐⭐ MODERATE
- **Time:** 1-2 weeks
- **Challenges:** 
  - Email/SMS integration (Supabase makes this easier)
  - Testing notification delivery
  - Subcontractor portal UI
- **Confidence:** High
- **Note:** Email is easier than SMS (SMS costs money per message)

#### **3. Budget Intelligence** - ⭐⭐⭐⭐ MODERATE-HARD
- **Time:** 2-3 weeks
- **Challenges:**
  - Statistical analysis logic
  - UI/UX for presenting suggestions
  - Confidence scoring algorithm
  - Avoiding false positives
- **Confidence:** Medium-High
- **Note:** Start simple (basic variance), add sophistication over time

### **Recommended Order:**
1. **Week 1:** Data Backup (quick win!)
2. **Week 2-3:** Schedule Notifications (high daily value)
3. **Week 4-6:** Budget Intelligence (transformative feature)
