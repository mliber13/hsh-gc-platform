# Testing User Management

Step-by-step guide to test the multi-user and role-based permission features.

## Prerequisites

1. ‚úÖ Supabase project set up
2. ‚úÖ Migration `001_initial_schema.sql` completed
3. ‚úÖ Migration `002_multi_user_shared_access.sql` completed

   ```sql
   SELECT email, role, organization_id FROM profiles;
   -- Should show admin@test.com with role='admin'
   ```

SELECT id, email, role FROM profiles WHERE email = 'viewer@test.com';

-- Try to create a project as viewer (should fail)
INSERT INTO projects (id, name, type, status, organization_id, created_by)
VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), 'Hacker Project', 'custom', 'estimating', 
        (SELECT organization_id FROM profiles WHERE email = 'viewer@test.com'),
        (SELECT id FROM profiles WHERE email = 'viewer@test.com'));
-- Should get: "permission denied for table projects"

   ```

2. **Try to sign up:**
   - Sign up with `expired@test.com`
   - Should still work but in new organization
   - Old invitation should be ignored

‚úÖ **Expected:** Expired invitations don't block signup

---

### Phase 8: Offline Mode

**Objective:** Verify offline mode still works

## Test Results Checklist

- [ ] First user automatically becomes admin
- [ ] Admin can invite users with different roles
- [ ] Invited users join with correct roles
- [ ] All users see shared organization data

## Common Issues

### Issue: User doesn't see shared data
**Fix:** Check `organization_id` matches in database:

SELECT email, organization_id FROM profiles;
```

### Issue: Permission denied errors
**Fix:** Verify RLS policies are enabled:
```sql
SELECT tablename, policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public';

**Fix:** Check invitation exists and isn't expired:
```sql
SELECT * FROM user_invitations WHERE status = 'pending';
```
